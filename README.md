This is the Princeton University Algorithms Course on Coursera by Robert Sedgewick I took with everything written in Ruby(very few Ruby cheat methods used), not Java, with bare to none Ruby methods used.

on the data structure that was used.

    - Balanced/Unbalanced
    - Left-Leaning Red/Black BST implementation
  -Binary Heap
    - Priority Queue
    - Heapsort
  -Find Union
    - Percolation
    - Social network connection
  -Hash Table implementation
    - Linked List Hashing
    - Linear Probing
  -Memoization
    - Fibonacci Recursion example
  -Sorting
    - Insertion Sort
    - Shell Sort
    - Heap Sort
    - Quick Sort
     -3way quicksort
    - Merge Sort - recursive
     -bottom up as well
   -Stack and Queue implementations
     -Linked List
     -Dynamic Array
     -DECK
   -Geometric Trees
     -Interval Search
